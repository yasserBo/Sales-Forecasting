# Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project uses time-series analysis to predict future sales based on historical data.

## Objectives
- Use strong time series analysis to forecast month sales for the next 12 months.
- Conduct hypothesis tests of sales .
- Learn how we can improve the forecast of sales and/or find products/regions most similar to the object of interest.

## Methods
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and transformed time-series data.
- **Modeling**: Used ARIMA and SARIMA models for forecasting.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Correlation analysis to identify factors affecting sales trends .
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Use t-tests or ANOVA on sales before and after the holiday or a product launch.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For analysis and modeling.
- SciPy: Hypothesis testing.
- scikit-learn: Similarity search and clustering for product or region grouping.
- **Matplotlib/seaborn**: For visualizing trends and forecasts.

## Key Results
- Achieved a forecast accuracy of 85% with the SARIMA model.
- Similarity Clustering: The following product categories were recognised and associated with similar sales trends to receive targeted promotional offers
